This is my implementation of the Zane-Ray Groups coding excercise for Java Developers. What a task this turned into -- it took me a lot longer than I anticipated but I am at a spot where I feel the project gives you a good feeling for my abilities.

Setup should be very easy - basically:

Clone the project using git and the following information: 

> cd /a/convenient/directory
> git clone https://github.com/gpatnude/zane-ray.git

Open your Eclipse IDE and import a project with existing sources.

Alternatively, you could open your Eclipse IDE and checkout a project from source control using the following:

GitHub repository path: https://github.com/gpatnude/zane-ray.git

The project uses Jetty and the Jetty-Maven plugin to execute. the servlet is configured to run on localhost and port 8080.  

At the command line or in your IDE, you need to 

mvn jetty:run

Then navigate with your favorite web browser to: http://localhost:8080/zrtest/
